## üîß MCP Client Configuration

### Claude Desktop
Add this to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport sse reflex https://reflex-mcp-server.fly.dev/sse
```

### Cursor/Windsurf
Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "reflex": {
      "serverType": "sse",
      "url": "https://reflex-mcp-server.fly.dev/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### Codex
Add this to your `~/.codex/config.toml` file:

```toml
[mcp_servers.reflex]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-proxy"]
env = { "MCP_PROXY_URL" = "https://reflex-mcp-server.fly.dev/sse" }
```

> **Note**: Codex currently requires MCP servers to communicate over stdio. Since our server uses SSE, you'll need the `@modelcontextprotocol/server-proxy` adapter to bridge the connection.

### Other MCP Clients
For other MCP-compatible tools, use:
- **SSE URL**: `https://reflex-mcp-server.fly.dev/sse`
- **HTTP URL**: `https://reflex-mcp-server.fly.dev/mcp`
