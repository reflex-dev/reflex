# Reflex Contributing Guidelines

For an extensive guide on the different ways to contribute to Reflex see our [Contributing Guide on Notion](https://www.notion.so/reflex-dev/2107ab2bc166497db951b8d742748284?v=f0eaff78fa984b5ab15d204af58907d7).

## Running a Local Build of Reflex

Here is a quick guide on how to run Reflex repo locally so you can start contributing to the project.

**Prerequisites:**

- Python >= 3.10
- Poetry version >= 1.4.0 and add it to your path (see [Poetry Docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for more info).

**1. Fork this repository:**
Fork this repository by clicking on the `Fork` button on the top right.

**2. Clone Reflex and navigate into the repo:**

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/reflex.git
cd reflex
```

**3. Install your local Reflex build:**

``` bash
poetry install
```

**4. Now create an examples folder so you can test the local Python build in this repository.**

- We have the `examples` folder in the `.gitignore`, so your changes in `reflex/examples` won't be reflected in your commit.

``` bash
mkdir examples
cd examples
```

**5. Init and Run**

``` bash
poetry run reflex init
poetry run reflex run
```

All the changes you make to the repository will be reflected in your running app.

- We have the examples folder in the .gitignore, so your changes in reflex/examples won't be reflected in your commit.

## ðŸ§ª Testing and QA

Any feature or significant change added should be accompanied with unit tests.

Within the 'test' directory of Reflex you can add to a test file already there or create a new test python file if it doesn't fit into the existing layout.

#### What to unit test?

- Any feature or significant change that has been added.
- Any edge cases or potential problem areas.
- Any interactions between different parts of the code.

## âœ… Making a PR

Once you solve a current issue or improvement to Reflex, you can make a PR, and we will review the changes.

Before submitting, a pull request, ensure the following steps are taken and test passing.

In your `reflex` directory run make sure all the unit tests are still passing using the following command.
This will fail if code coverage is below 70%.

``` bash
poetry run pytest tests/units --cov --no-cov-on-fail --cov-report= 
```

Next make sure all the following tests pass. This ensures that every new change has proper documentation and type checking.

``` bash
poetry run ruff check .
poetry run pyright reflex tests
find reflex tests -name "*.py" -not -path reflex/reflex.py | xargs poetry run darglint
```

Finally, run `ruff` to format your code.

``` bash
poetry run ruff format .
```

Consider installing git pre-commit hooks so Ruff, Pyright, Darglint and `make_pyi` will run automatically before each commit.
Note that pre-commit will only be installed when you use a Python version >= 3.10.

``` bash
pre-commit install
```

That's it you can now submit your PR. Thanks for contributing to Reflex!


## Editing Templates 

To edit the templates in Reflex you can do so in two way.

Change to the basic `blank` template can be done in the `reflex/.templates/apps/blank` directory.

Others templates can be edited in their own repository. For example the `sidebar` template can be found in the [`reflex-sidebar`](https://github.com/reflex-dev/sidebar-template) repository.


## Other Notes

For some pull requests when adding new components you will have to generate a pyi file for the new component. This is done by running the following command in the `reflex` directory.

(Please check in with the team before adding a new component to Reflex we are cautious about adding new components to Reflex's core.)

``` bash
poetry run python scripts/make_pyi.py 
```
