"""Handle dynamic routes in static exports via client-side routing.

Works with /utils/client_side_routing.js to handle the redirect and state.

When the user hits a 404 accessing a route, redirect them to the same page,
setting a reactive state var "routeNotFound" to true if the redirect fails.  The
`wait_for_client_redirect` function will render the component only after
routeNotFound becomes true.
