        """Create an Image component from next/image.

        Args:
            *children: The children of the component.
            width: The width of the image.
            height: The height of the image.
            src: This can be either an absolute external URL, or an internal path
            alt: Used to describe the image for screen readers and search engines.
            loader: A custom function used to resolve image URLs.
            fill: A boolean that causes the image to fill the parent element, which is useful when the width and height are unknown. Default to True
            sizes: A string, similar to a media query, that provides information about how wide the image will be at different breakpoints.
            quality: The quality of the optimized image, an integer between 1 and 100, where 100 is the best quality and therefore largest file size. Defaults to 75.
            priority: When true, the image will be considered high priority and preload. Lazy loading is automatically disabled for images using priority.
            placeholder: A placeholder to use while the image is loading. Possible values are blur, empty, or data:image/.... Defaults to empty.
            loading: The loading behavior of the image. Defaults to lazy. Can hurt performance, recommended to use `priority` instead.
            blur_data_url: A Data URL to be used as a placeholder image before the src image successfully loads. Only takes effect when combined with placeholder="blur".
            on_load: Fires when the image has loaded.
            on_error: Fires when the image has an error.
            style: The style of the component.
            key: A unique key for the component.
            id: The id for the component.
            class_name: The class name for the component.
            autofocus: Whether the component should take the focus once the page is loaded
            custom_attrs: custom attribute
            **props:The props of the component.

        Returns:
            _type_: _description_
